            <h2> Loading screen of misinformation</h2>
            <p>Dependence on Technology.
                A fake, infinite loading screen is designed to test a viewer's patience. It will include a fixed
                scrolling option. To maintain engagement, the screen periodically displays messages to hold their
                attention, such as "Almost there!" or "What color are your shoes?". As the user continues to scroll,
                these messages gradually evolve into a series of misleading or nonsensical facts, reflecting random,
                unreliable information found on the web.

            <h2>Ads Generator</h2>
            <div><img src="img/ads.jpeg.png" alt=""> </div>
            <p>A website that generates countless pop up ads, one with every click. Something to demonstrate over
                consumption, scams, and overexposure. One ad clearly saying “Click here to download a cute virus!”, “bob
                wants to meet up”, “you just won a free concert ticket, buy the 100$ membership to claim”, or “did you
                try our new special coffee” appearing more than once, etc.

            <h2> Get a Job</h2>
            <p>This website would include a very long form to fill out to demonstrate the struggled of finding a job
                despite being fully qualified. Some questions will have nothing to do with the position. It would feel
                like wasted time because in the end, the answer would declide the application. Example: did you attach a
                cover letter? Did you upload a video of your self introduction? Do you have a degree? You need to pass a
                preliminary test before the interview, did you provide your work? Are you skilled in fashion design,
                screen printing and cooking? etc.

            <h2>Let's Gamble</h2>
            <div><img src="img/gamble.jpeg.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>The website would give the visitor a set amount of currency to gamble with. The system could include a
                typing bar, on which we can type down the amount of money we want to bet. It would be a game of win or
                lose. The player will keep winning until they bet over a certain amount of their budget. Ex: 3/4 of what
                they own. The countless wins would encourage the visitor to play around and increase their bets. This
                website is a simulation of real life gambling consequences.

            <h2>The overthinking simulator </h2>
            <p>
                The overthinking simulator. A chatting dialogue based on simple questions, except the answers are never
                ones we want to hear. A simulation of anxiety and how it affects the way of handling future situations
                or anticipation in terms of conversations. Example: “When are you coming back” = “Oh you thought I’d be
                coming back?”
